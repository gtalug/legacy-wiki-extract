<p>Linux has several more or less popular "desktop environments" including <a href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/GNOME" title="GNOME">GNOME</a>, <a href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/KDE" title="KDE">KDE</a>, <a href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/XFCE" title="XFCE">XFCE</a>, <a href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/GNUstep" title="GNUstep">GNUstep</a>.
</p><p>A Desktop Environment typically provides icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers, graphical libraries, and other application services.  
</p><p>Perhaps the first major one coining the name was <a class="extiw" href="/web/20080820075544/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment" title="Wikipedia:Common Desktop Environment">CDE</a>, a proprietary system created by HP.  It combined libraries to provide common services along with some applications written using those libraries, and was then intended to be extended to support additional applications.
</p><p><a href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/KDE" title="KDE">KDE</a> was founded in 1996 as something a reaction to CDE; the desire was to have a powerful "free software" alternative.  <a href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/GNOME" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> was founded in 1997 as a reaction to KDE, because people were concerned about licensing of some of the libraries used in KDE.
</p><p>These systems are not <a class="new" href="/web/20080820075544/http://tlug.ss.org/index.php?title=Category:Window_Manager&amp;action=edit" title="Category:Window Manager">window managers</a>, although they may include one.  They consist of large sets of libraries intended to allow applications not to need to keep creating application services from scratch.  There are common:
</p>
<ul><li> graphical libraries
</li><li> translation tools to support multilingual applications
</li><li> XML parsers and other configuration management tools
</li><li> widget and icon sets
</li><li> Interprocess communications protocols
</li><li> user interface design standards
</li></ul>
<p>Each such environment has numerous applications built atop these "base services."
