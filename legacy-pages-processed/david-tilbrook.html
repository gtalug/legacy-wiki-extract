</p><p>David Tilbrook, one of the first UNIX users in Canada, is the Chief Scientist of <a class="external text" href="/web/20091111170533/http://www.qef.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.qef.com/">QEF Advanced Software Inc.</a> Previously he worked at MKS, SNI, CMU, IST, SDL, BNSR, and HCR, the last of which he was a founder. He studied at ic.ac.uk and U of T. 
</p><p>His MSc thesis, NewsWhole, was one of the first CAD systems and the first system to use iconic cursors and faded light buttons. For many years NewsWhole was the subject of a question on Kelly Booth's computer graphics exams and the NewsWhole movie was shown at the 25th ACM SigGraph conference as one of the pioneer computer graphic systems. 
</p><p>But graphics was just an 18 month diversion. 
</p><p>His primary interest is large scale software construction and the problems that it entails.  (One of the results was the creation of a toolset called <a class="external text" href="/web/20091111170533/http://www.qef.com/html/quickintro.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.qef.com/html/quickintro.html">QEF</a>.)
</p><p>Last year (1999) he lectured on Software Engineering at UofT and IBM and got a 94% re-take rating in the anti-calendar, which he offers as empirical proof of a long held belief that S.E. can be fun and entertaining. 
</p><p>David has been program chair for seven EurOpen and Usenix Conferences, (the only program chair to have dropped trou), is an honourary life-time member of EurOpen, and still uses a line editor (<a href="/web/20091111170533/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Qed" title="Qed">qed</a>).
