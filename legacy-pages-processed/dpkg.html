<p>DPKG or Debian Package is the low level tool developed originally for Debian to manage installation of software packages.
</p><p>As a low level tool, most end users are encouraged to use higher level tools like apt, aptitude or synaptic to do actual installs.
</p><p>These tools assists in both building and installing software packages, with an awareness of dependencies (e.g. - KSpread, the KDE spreadsheet, depends on having various KDE and Qt libraries, and so will require that, to install kspread, the other required system components be installed as well).  
</p><p>It supports the notion of versioning, so that your system can be aware of what components must be upgraded together.  
</p><p>It also supports doing relatively orderly deinstallation of software; you can ask to remove a package, and this will be done, if that doesn't break something else by removing some dependency that was required to remain.
</p><p>Note that DPKG is used by various <a href="/web/20081011170034/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Category:Linux_Distributions" title="Category:Linux Distributions">Category:Linux Distributions</a>.
