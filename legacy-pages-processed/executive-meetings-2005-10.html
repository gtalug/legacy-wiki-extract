<p>Chris Browne offers regrets at his absence for this meeting as due to being out of province on vacation.
</p><p>New business should include:
</p>
<ul><li> Assigning board members to executive positions
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Clarifying what are <i>and aren't</i> proper things for GTALUG board members to do.  Chris is somewhat concerned at attempts to present GTALUG as being some sort of consulting firm.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Making sure someone has as a Real Soon Now task uploading an electronic copy of constitution and bylaws to the Wiki (or some place similar).  Actually, this ought to be followup of old business...
</li></ul>
