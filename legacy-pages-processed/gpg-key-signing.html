<p>Something we should do is to encourage a GPG Key Signing.  There would be merit to holding a meeting on the topic, but absent that, it would be valuable for individuals to see about going through the authentication processes of signing keys and becoming part of the Web of Trust...

Individuals who are interested in doing so may individually register, and publicize their interest and their keys.  In addition, if you are holding an event where a keysigning could take place, you can indicate location and time so that people may find the opportunity to sign keys.  It also provides some assistance at putting together the keyring listing...

<p>Unfortunately, it is common for formal key signing parties to involve painful amounts of formality and pre-preparations, commonly including such things as:
</p>
<ul><li> Printing up sheets of participants' keys so that, if the sheet has 30 people on it, everyone arranges themself in that order, and then walk past one another in sequence, showing one another their ID cards.  It's efficient, but you need to pre-arrange keys from all 30 people.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Displaying the ID cards on an overhead projector so everyone can verify the ID simultaneously.
</li></ul>
<p>If you prepare your own "GPG business cards," and carry around a dozen of these in a pouch on your pack, it's easy to arrange a signing with any small group of interested signers that may pop up.
</p><p>You might use, for this, such free software as:
