A long-time Linux supporter and the TLUG mailing list moderator,
Jan Carlson died suddenly and peacefully last Sunday morning.
 
The funeral is to be held Thursday at 1:00 PM with visitation starting
at 12:00 PM.
The location will be:
        The Simple Alternative,
        275 Lesmill Rd.,
        416-441-1580
Directions:
        Lesmill runs east off Leslie Street (south of the 401).
 
Jan's sister suggested that in lieu of flowers, Jan would have
appreciated donations made to the Canadian Cancer Society.
 
In keeping with his long history as a Linux supporter, Jan
will be buried in his Linux penguin t-shirt.
 
He will truly be missed by all who knew him.
