Spoke again to the people at Centennial today. Here is
a summary of where things stand at present with the
planned August install fest at Centennial College.

Planned Date: Saturday, August 27, 2005

Planned Time: to be determined/announced.

Planned Place: Room 418, 755 Morningside Avenue (the
Centennial HP Science and Technology Centre).

Room 418 is listed on the Centennial College floor
plan as a "Boardroom". Power into room 418 is 45 amps
(enough to power 6 HEAVILY loaded PCs/monitors). There
is an Internet connection into the room.

Centennial can supply some (I suggested 4) monitors so
that anyone who wants to take his/her desktop PC to
the install fest by TTC doesn't have to carry a
monitor as well.

Things to be done in the near future (and I will be
working on), a promotional flier (as before posting at
Centennial the flier will have to be approved by both
the Centennial administration and the student
association (sigh)).

Between now and August 27 the following things will
have to sourced:

- Available volunteers familiar with doing various
  installs.
- Install CDs for various distribution, including (but
  not limited to):
  - Debian
  - Fedora Core
  - Mandrake
  - Suse
- Table clothes to protect boardroom tables.
- Misc. parts box:
  - A few keyboards/mice/mouse pads.
  - A few power bars/power cords
  - A few lengths of Cat 5 Ethernet cable
  - TLUG promo material
  - 6+ port hub/router
