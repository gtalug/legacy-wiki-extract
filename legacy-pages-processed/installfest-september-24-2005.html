<p>We have them every semester but they're getting slow (I think we ran out of students to install for). I was wondering whether the GTALUG can help us get more clients :)
</p><p>We will be installing SuSE 9.3 from CDs and DVDs (all copies of originals). Windows XP too if you really want it (why on earth would you), you'll need to get that activated yourself.
</p><p>SuSE is not the only option, it's just the only one (that and my favourite <a href="/web/20081122041909/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Slackware" title="Slackware">Slackware</a>) we can be sure to have CDs for. If you want fedora or whatever else just bring the media with you and we'll help you put it on.
</p><p>Students will be doing the installations but that's a good thing, believe me. I should know, I am one of them :) We will have partition magic to shrink your windows partition and squeeze linux in. Of course shrinking partitions can be a sorry business so be sure to back up everything important before the big day.
</p><p>No better way to start a new school year then with linux, tell your friends! (that sounds good, I'm going to put it on a poster)
</p><p>You have to register so we know we can handle the number of people who show up.
</p><p>Send questions to adumitra@learn.senecac.on.ca
</p><p>See you there!
