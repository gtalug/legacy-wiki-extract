<td style="background:#efefef;" valign="top"> <b>What</b> </td><td> Prepare for a day of lunacy, fun, coffee, donuts (celebrating the official Donut Day holiday), and Linux!  This is a great opportunity for new users and their friends to get help installing Linux, as well as a sort of hack-fest for all who are trying to work out installation issues (such as installing to a PDA, etc.).  This also a nice chance to meet people in the lug and just hang out, watch, and learn.

<p><b>RSVP to</b> : <a href="/web/20081122043304/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Leah" title="User:Leah">User:Leah</a>
</p><p><b>Why RSVP?</b> : The venue is a limited size, and while I doubt it will be a problem, if we have too many RSVP's we are going to have to turn people away.  The RSVP will help us to have a good idea for how many volunteers we need, equipment, shifts, donuts (don't want to run out, do we?), etc.

<td style="background:#efefef;" valign="top"> <b>Volunteering</b> </td><td> We need volunteers for the following:
<ul><li> Put up flyers advertising the event around town (universities and schools are often a good place to start)
</li><li> Plan to attend the install fest, bring useful software, laptops, documentation, etc.
</li></ul>
<p>We need the following equipment for the event:
</p>
<ul><li> a few additional power strips; UPS would also be cool
</li><li> switches and hubs
</li><li> coffee
</li><li> donuts
</li></ul>
