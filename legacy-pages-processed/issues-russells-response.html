&gt; Could someone provide a quick rundown of the major technology-related
&gt; legal issues facing the Canadian public?  (Who are, for the most part,
&gt; generally unaware - or uninterested.)

  I recommend you follow the discussions around Richard Stallman's
visit to Calgary http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/view/844

The topic of the visit is software patents, and Brett is organizing to
bring our petition to the event which involves copyright.

Here is my personal summary:

a) Patent:

  Non-transparent and unaccountable expansion by CIPO of patentability
to software and business models.  Previously CIPO was denying software
patents, and now they are granting them.  No change in Canadian
legislation, precedent or policy/regulations happened, they just
re-interpreted existing laws with the "help" of patent lawyer extremists
to now grant them.
   - In 2003 I was hired by ICT branch to do a report on software
patents  http://www.flora.ca/patent2003/
   - This year (End of 2004) I filed an ATIP request to try to force
CIPO to disclose their "consultation" and the process they went through
to now grant software patents.  I received a reply mid-March 2005, which
included the submission from the patent lawyers to mis-interpret
existing  law, precedent and regulations to expand patentability.  The
most visible vendor promoting software patents was IBM, who I strongly
believe needs to be recognized as the greatest threat to Free Software.

b) Copyright

 Attempts to put the Internet genie back in the bottle with two broad
methods under copyright, and then some 'misc' issues.

  i) Introduce legislation that would try to re-impost
broadcast/publisher style bottlenecks on distribution of creativity.
This can be seen with legal protection for DRM, which is the legal
protection for a technologically protected tie between content with
creator/viewers that are controlled by a specific software vendor.

Control through DRM
http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/view/845
(There are MANY articles on this from many people!)

  This is also what so-called "ISP liability" is about, making it easy
for old-media companies to tie new-media creators and publishers up in
legal threats.

DRM and ISP liability are just two policies implemented in the
controversial DMCA in the USA.  In Canada parliament feels pressure to
ratify/implement the 1996 WIPO treaties, even though they have offered
no indication that they understand the implications of such policy.

  ii) Introduce legislation that would replace copyright with a "right
of remuneration".  Copyright was traditionally an exclusive right where
the copyright holder could require permission of others to
copy/communicate the work.  This requirement of permission was business
model neutral, allowing for innovation in business models.  Alternatives
to after-the-fact royalty payments include Open Access (where the
creator is paid up-front for work that is then made royalty-free for
distribution and use), Free/Libre and Open Source Software (wide variety
of business models), and Creative Commons (grant certain permissions
widely, keep other uses as exclusive).

  Statutory and Extended licensing is a technique where the exclusive
right is removed and replaced with a right to collect a royalty,
essentially legislating away all alternative business models.

 iii) Less important are issues with photography.  While not critical
to us, these changes make illegal current wide practice of assuming that
the owner of a camera has the legal right to develop their own film
regardless of who took the picture.  Changes to the law would mean that
the photographer would own the picture.  Current practice will not
change, which will mean that these law changes will just be inducing
massive amounts of infringement.  The problem here isn't the law, but
the fact that copyright will receive less and less respect as it differs
from common practice and rational understanding of the law.  These
proposed changes demonstrate to me that parliament is still not
recognizing that copyright affects ALL Canadians (not just old-media
companies with funds to hire lawyers), and that if it is to be respected
must be greatly simplified from the previous top-heavy
broadcast/publisher era.

c) Competition: Many studies have suggested that in software it is
competition and not exclusive rights that drive innovation.  While this
is true, competition/anti-trust offices have been paralyzed to handle
enforcement in technology as they have generally carved-out PCT (patent,
copyright, trademark and related rights) from enforcement.  This is why
the EU and US anti-trust cases against Microsoft have been ineffective.
 The problem is not with Microsoft who are simply exploiting current
legal regimes, but the laws which manufacture these harmful monopolies
in the first place.
  I wrote about this in a submission to the competition bureau, raising
the issue of legal protection for DRM and software patents as conflicts
with competition policy  http://www.flora.ca/competition2003/  .
  Until the Canadian Competition Bureau is adequately up-to-speed on
these issues, Industry Canada will be ineffective in any attempt to have
an Innovation Agenda.  Industry Canada is currently been carrying out an
anti-Innovation agenda by strengthening rights to exclude while carving
out those new rights from competition enforcement.

P.S.  Let us know when you have your WIKI ready, and we'll link to it
from our links page.  We should probably have our own summary-of-issues
page, and just need a volunteer willing to come forward to maintain this.
