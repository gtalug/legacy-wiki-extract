<p>Issues to be dealt with for GTALug and IT360:
</p><p>- Booth furnishings
</p>
<pre> - David Collier-Brown is sorting out details for a booth backdrop
 - Colin McGregor and Bill Thanis are sorting out getting bar stools for the booth (so volunteers can sit down and still look visitors in the eye).
 - There is a tentative offer of a folding table to be used at the booth from Drew Sullivan 
</pre>
<p>- Booth handouts
</p>
<pre> - Membership forms
</pre>
<p>- Press Release
</p><p>- 2.25" Button artwork still needed.
</p><p>- Posters?
</p><p>- Booth staffing
</p>
<pre> - Set-up a schedule this year
   - Core reliable people on a schedule
   - use additional people as floaters
 - Meng Cheah has offered to be a core person for Tuesday morning.
</pre>
<p>Volunteers wanted:
</p>
<pre> - Booth
   - Build
   - Set-up
   - Staff
   - Tear down
 - Poster designers / creators
 - Handout authors
</pre>
<p>Volunteer review:
</p>
<pre> - We are going to want to have a review meeting with the volunteers to note:
   - The GTALug message and staying on message.
   - What is expected of the volunteers:
     - The 6-2-1 rule:
       - At least 6 hours sleep per 24 hours during the event.
       - At least 2 solid meals per 24 hours during the event.
       - At least 1 shower/bath per 24 hours during the event.
     - Basicly, if you are falling asleep, or distracted by hunger in the booth, or ... you're not of much use to the group by being in the booth.
</pre>
<p>Note, that there are restrictions imposed by the convention center during set-up / teardown, where at sometimes they will require all people on the show floor to be wearing a hardhat and steel toed shoes/boots (and at other times the hardhat but not the steel toed footware will be optional). So. anyone who wants to be part of the set-up/teardown crew will need at least steel toed footware...
