<p>Note:  This material should probably get moved into the Linux Distribution category page.
</p><p>A Linux distribution represents a set of software including Linux that you can install on a computer.
</p>
<ul><li> You start with some sort of "boot loader," some basic software to load Linux from some location (perhaps a floppy, CDROM, USB key, or loaded across a network)
</li><li> It then boots the Linux kernel, and provides some system to allow you to configure various things on your system such as a network connection.  This configuration is usually set up to persist so that you don't need to reinstall things from scratch each time you turn your computer on.
</li><li> Various other software is made available.  Some distributions offer literally thousands of applications of incredible variety.  One of the important distinctions between Linux distributions is the set of software installation tools.  The tool RPM, popularized by Red Hat Software, is one popular installation tool, also used in systems like Fedora, SuSE, and CentOS.  Debian GNU/Linux introduced dpkg, which is used by a number of distributions such as Ubuntu.
</li><li> Different distributions have variations in how they manage system configuration as well as in what versions of software they include.  Since software that is being actively developed frequently sees new versions, you can discover that one distribution may temporarily be "more modern" than another.  The different styles of system configuration will tend to persist, but they all get upgraded periodically to include more recent versions of the applications they have in common.

<p>When you find differences between distributions, you'll find they fall into several categories, some more "permanent" than others:
</p>
<ul><li> One distribution may have a later version of some pieces of software than others.  This will often resolve itself, over time, as all of the distributions are plucking sources from the same streams.  Newer Linux kernels, newer versions of Apache, newer versions of whatever, can be expected to become available on newer versions of distributions.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> On the other hand, once a distribution has chosen a set of package management software, that tends to be mighty difficult to change.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> A little more difficult to measure in its effects can be the <i>policy</i> of the distribution.  Slackware has always used a BSD-style init system, which has quite a number of side implications.  A number of distributions have followed the <a class="external text" href="/web/20080704190638/http://www.pathname.com/fhs/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>; Red Hat has resisted it, with the result that there are persistent differences between those sets of distributions.  Debian's <i>stable</i> releases have a huge number of tests to pass, with the result that they tend to have fairly old versions of software by the time a release can be declared <i>stable.</i></li></ul></div>
