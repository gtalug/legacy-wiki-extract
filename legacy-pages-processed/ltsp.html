<p><a class="external text" href="/web/20081006075712/http://ltsp.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://ltsp.org/">LTSP</a> provides "thin client" support.  That is, you connect a bunch of diskless computers that run very little more than the <a href="/web/20081006075712/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Linux_Kernel" title="Linux Kernel">Linux Kernel</a> and the <a href="/web/20081006075712/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/X_Window_System" title="X Window System">X Window System</a> to a central server that hosts applications (perhaps a web browser, like <a href="/web/20081006075712/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Mozilla" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> or a document system like <a href="/web/20081006075712/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org" title="OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>).
</p><p>The individual computers don't need to be terribly powerful as they aren't doing much work beyond displaying output from applications.
</p><p>There is even a savings of resources on the central server where the applications run, as, even if 10 users are running the Firefox web browser, there only needs to be a single copy of the Firefox binaries and associated libraries in memory.  If they were running the applications on separate machines, there would be 10 copies of the application...
</p><p>In principle, this is a way to reuse elderly computer hardware.  Machines not powerful enough to run large applications may still be sufficient to provide display services.
