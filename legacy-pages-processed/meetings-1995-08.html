 **TORONTO LINUX USERS GROUP: 1st year**
 
 Dear Linuxers,
 
 The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
 at 7 pm in the North York Public Library on Wednesday, August 30, 1995.
 
 The topic of this meeting's presentation will be the newly released
 Caldera Network Desktop and the speaker will be Yours Truly.
 
 This is also the first full year since the founding of Toronto Linux 
 Users Group, and I am especially happy to see how far Linux has gone
 during this year towards becoming a viable and 'hot' commercial 
 development platform. 
 
 Caldera brings an uncompromising graphical concept to Linux, and
 adds increased functionality such as a full Netware client and
 a production grade font server to the basic networking capabilities
 of Linux.
 
 For my presentation, I have put up a few screen shots of the desktop 
 on my web page, which is located at:
           
            http://abyss.idirect.com/las.html

 The presentation will be followed by a question and answer session.
 
 
 Location:   Meeting Room 2
             North York Public Library
             5120 Yonge Street
                
  
 How to Get There:
                       
           By the subway: take the Yonge subway
