Dear Linuxers,

The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
at 7:30 pm at the Swan Building, 5415 Dundas Street West,
on Tuesday, March 26, 1996.

The topic will be "PGP Illustrated" and the featured speaker
of the meeting will be Frank D.A. Luet (fdau...@io.org).

Frank will provide an overview of PGP, Phil Zimmermann's
public key encryption method, which has become the de facto
standard for secure communication over the internet.

We wish to thank  Internet Direct for donating their
state-of-the-art multimedia conference room for this and
subsequent Linux meetings.

Location:   Suite 301
            5415 Dundas Street West
            Etobicoke          

How to Get There:

           By the subway: take the Bloor subway
           to the Kipling station.  The Swan building is
           two blocks west of the Kipling station,
           next to the large "Canadian Tire" plaza.

           For those who are driving, ample and free parking
           is available in the parking lot just south
           of the Swan building.

Everyone is welcome to attend. Be there!
