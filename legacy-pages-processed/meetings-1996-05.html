Dear Linuxers,

The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
at 7:30 pm at the Swan Building, 5415 Dundas Street West,
on Tuesday, May 28, 1996.

This meeting will introduce and demonstrate the current status of
the Embedded Linux-8086 (Elks) project. Elks broadens
the range of Linux supported platforms, which currently include
the DEC Alpha, Intel 386/486/586 , MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC, and Motorola
m86k family, to the Intel 80186 microcontroller, which is widely used
in industrial and scientific embedded applications.

I'd like to take this oppurtunity also to cordially invite you to
visit our new home page which is located at:

   &lt;URL:http:/abyss.idirect.com:/tlug/&gt;

Produced and maintained by Michel Afar, this page provides an
excellent starting point for exploring Linux resources on the
Internet and contains pointers to our meetings and other
activities in the Toronto area.

Meeting details follow:

Location:   Suite 301
            5415 Dundas Street West
            Etobicoke          

How to Get There:

           By the subway: take the Bloor subway
           to the Kipling station.  The Swan building is
           two blocks west of the Kipling station,
           next to the large "Canadian Tire" plaza.

           For those who are driving, ample and free parking
           is available in the parking lot just south
           of the Swan building.

Everyone is welcome to attend.
