Dear Unix Users,

The October meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
at 7:30 pm at the Swan Building, 5415 Dundas Street West,
on Tuesday, October 30, 1996.

By popular demand, the topic of this meeting will be 'Installing
Linux', and the meeting will provide hands-on experience with installing
a full Unix system with networking and X Windows support. The meeting
will be of interest to both the novice Unix user and the seasoned
professional alike.

The presenter will be Colin A. McGregor, who works as a system administrator
at Internet Direct.

I'd like to take this oppurtunity also to cordially invite you to
visit our new home page which is located at:

   &lt;URL:http://abyss.idirect.com:/tlug/&gt;

Produced and maintained by Michel Afar, this page provides an
excellent starting point for exploring Linux resources on the
Internet and contains pointers to our meetings and other
activities in the Toronto area.

Meeting details follow:

Location:   Suite 207
            5415 Dundas Street West
            Etobicoke          

How to Get There:

           By the subway: take the Bloor subway
           to the Kipling station.  The Swan building is
           two blocks west of the Kipling station,
           next to the large "Canadian Tire" plaza.

           For those who are driving, ample and free parking
           is available in the parking lot just south
           of the Swan building.

Everyone is welcome to attend.

but not the day of the meeting. The meeting will be held on Tuesday,
October *29*, at 7:30 pm. Below is the corrected meeting announcement.
