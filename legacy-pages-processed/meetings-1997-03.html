Dear Friends,

The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
at 7:30 pm at the Swan Building, 5415 Dundas Street West,
on Tuesday, March 25, 1997.

The topic of this meeting will be "Programming with TCL/TK and TIX"
and the presenter will be Avy Moise, who has been using TCL/TK
with great success for creating scientific imaging applications.

TCL/TK is a flexible and extensible programming language
developed by Sun Microsystems, and TIX is a popular GUI interface builder
kit based on TCL/TK which simplifies the task of rolling out graphical
applications.

I'd like to take this oppurtunity also to cordially invite you to
visit our new home page which is located at:

   &lt;URL:http://abyss.idirect.com:/tlug/&gt;

Produced and maintained by Michel Afar, this page provides an
excellent starting point for exploring Linux resources on the
Internet and contains pointers to our meetings and other
activities in the Toronto area.

Meeting details follow:

Location:   Suite 207
            5415 Dundas Street West
            Etobicoke          

How to Get There:

           By the subway: take the Bloor subway
           to the Kipling station.  The Swan building is
           two blocks west of the Kipling station,
           next to the large "Canadian Tire" plaza.

           For those who are driving, ample and free parking
           is available in the parking lot just south
           of the Swan building.

Everyone is welcome to attend.
