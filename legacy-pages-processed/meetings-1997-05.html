Subject: LOCAL: Toronto--First review of Caldera Open Linux

Dear Friends,

The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
at 7:30 pm at the Swan Building, 5415 Dundas Street West,
on Tuesday, May 27, 1997.

The featured speaker will be Greg Weir, webmaster at Internet Direct, and he
will present Caldera Open Linux, Caldera's latest and most ambitious attempt
to date to become the standard Linux distibution in the internet server as
well as the enterprise computing market.  

Greg was a participant in Caldera's beta testing program, and he
has first hand experience of the quality approach Caldera used to
define this new distribution.

I'd like to take this oppurtunity also to cordially invite you to
visit our new home page which is located at:

   &lt;URL:http://abyss.idirect.com:/tlug/&gt;

Produced and maintained by Michel Afar, this page provides an
excellent starting point for exploring Linux resources on the
Internet and contains pointers to our meetings and other
activities in the Toronto area.

Meeting details follow:

Location:   Suite 207
            5415 Dundas Street West
            Etobicoke          

How to Get There:

           By the subway: take the Bloor subway
           to the Kipling station.  The Swan building is
           two blocks west of the Kipling station,
           next to the large "Canadian Tire" plaza.

           For those who are driving, ample and free parking
           is available in the parking lot just south
           of the Swan building.

Everyone is welcome to attend.

        Cheers,
              Laszlo Herczeg
