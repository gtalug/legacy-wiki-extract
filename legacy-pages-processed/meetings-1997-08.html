Subject: Toronto Linux Group plans to host Linux Expo

Dear friends,

Because almost half the members are either coming back from vacation or
filling in for someone who is gone on vacation (yes, we all know the feeling),
there will not be a TLUG meeting this month.

This doesn't mean that I am idle. As you know, I am setting out to organize a
large Linux Expo in Toronto in the coming year in conjunction with the
Ottawa Linux group. This will be an International event, with well known
Linux luminaries and a budget.

The purpose of the Expo will be, first, to expose Linux as a popular and
viable alternative to other operating systems in the enterprise computing,
secondly, to fulfil our dreams of bringing key Linux speakers such as Linus
Torvalds and Alan Cox to Toronto, and thirdly, to break even with the budget
and potentially to generate revenue for our group.  Both Caldera and Linux
International has offered moral and financial support to see through this
large event.

Have a great summer or what's left of it!

In closing, I'd like to append here Paul's King notice of his new Linux PPP
web pages. I am very pleased with his contribution both to our users at
Internet Direct, and to the Linux Internet community. Please note that the
PPP scripts on his site will work with most local providers, after adjusting
them for the login procedure.

Subject: Linux PPP at Internet Direct

To Linux users at idirect:

I have posted some updates to the web page. It is still a bit rough
in places, but as I have time I will update it.

The web pages are about logging on to Internet Direct through a
LINUX PPP. It contains scripts, hints, and suggestions.

The actual location of the page is at:
        http://webhome.idirect.com/~pking/dialin.html

You can can also see texts of the scripts here and at
        tlug.general
        idirect.general
        idirect.support
in the newsgroups.

Hope this helps people.

Paul King
