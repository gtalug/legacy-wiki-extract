Dear Friends,

The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held
at 7:30 pm at the Swan Building, 5415 Dundas Street West,
on Tuesday, October 28, 1997. 

Our special guest for the meeting will be James Bailie, a Linux developer
from London, Ontario, who is the author of "Newsperuser", an X based offline
newsreader for Linux. To view a screenshot of Newsperuser, please visit:

Please note: as of last month, we have moved the meetings from the second
floor of the Swan building to the main floor of the same building. 

I'd like to take this oppurtunity also to cordially invite you to
visit our recently updated home page which is located at:

   &lt;URL:http://abyss.idirect.com:/tlug/&gt;

Produced and maintained by Michel Afar, this page provides an
excellent starting point for exploring Linux resources on the
Internet and contains pointers to our meetings and other
activities in the Toronto area.
