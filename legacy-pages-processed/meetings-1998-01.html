Dear Friends,

The next meeting of the Toronto Linux Users Group will be held at 7:30 pm at
the Main Auditorium (L72) of the Library Building, Ryerson Polytechnical
University, 350 Victoria Street, on Thursday, January 15th, 1998. (see
attached map, and http://www.ryerson.ca/tour/campusmap.html for the campus
map)

Our featured guest for the meeting will be Bob Young, president of RedHat
software, whose name is well known as one of the leading developers of Linux
distributions. If you have ever wondered what RedHat is up to these days,
and how do they prosper by giving away software for free, this meeting will
give you the definitive answer. We would like to use this meeting also to
announce our LinuxNorth International conference, which is slated to
coincide with the summer Comdex this July here in Toronto.

Bob's talk is entitled:
"Red Hat Software, Inc. and Cooperatively Developed Software" and he
will cover the following topics:
        - The role of commercial companies like Red Hat to
cooperatively developed software and the GPL (GNU Public Licence).
        - How Red Hat considers the GPL to be the "best design
decision we have ever made".
        - How RedHat is able to compete successfully with the world's
largest and most profitable software companies.
        - "So, if you give all your  software away at no cost,
how do you make money?"

Everyone is welcome to attend!

Detailed directions and a map follows:

Main Auditorium (L72), Library Building
350 Victoria Street, Ryerson University, Toronto

Via subway: Get off the Dundas Street stop.  From the north-east corner of
Yonge and Dundas (diagonally opposite from the Eaton Centre), walk east 30
metres to Victoria Street (by the Tim Horton's).  Turn left/north.  Walk 50
metres past the Ryerson parking lot to Gould St.  Cross the street and
continue 10 metres up the pedestrian extension of Victoria.  Turn left/west,
go through the bank of doors, and straight ahead (past the escalator) is
L72.  

By car:  approach from Younge Street or Dundas Street.
Parking locations are indicated in the attached map. Please note that
parking is both expensive and scarce in downtown Toronto, so you may wish to
allow time for finding suitable parking, or just take the subway which is
the most effective way.

Please note that a detailed map of all Ryerson buildings can be found
