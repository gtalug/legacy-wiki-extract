<p>HARK!  Good Tidings!
</p><p>Mike Waychison *has* secured a venue for the October meeting of the
Toronto Linux Users Group.  Thanks, Mike!
</p><p>In fact, Mike was successful last month as well, but... the U of T
didn't communicate that bit of information.  Picture the sprinter who
doesn't realize the race is over; or better, the "instruction" that
loops... and loops...  "Lather. Rinse. Repeat."
</p><p>Details are sketchy at the moment but this much is known:
</p><p>We will continue to meet on the second Tuesday of the month, through
December, at the St. George campus of the U of T.  The room will be
available to us from 7:00 pm until 10:00 pm.  Mark your Calendars /
DayTimers / PIMs / PDAs. Put yet another PostIt Note on your monitor.
</p><p>The meeting will begin with a half-hour informal Q &amp; A session from 7:00
to 7:30 hosted by Drew Sullivan.  Anyone who is able get there in that
time slot is welcome to participate on the "Q" *or* the "A" side.
</p><p>The meeting will formally start at 7:30 sharp.  A brief period will be
allotted for TLUG and SIG-related announcements/news.  If you have a
contribution, please contact me at tecnicol@attcanada.ca
</p><p>The Speaker Presentation(s) will immediately follow group business.
Questions and comments will be addressed during or following the talk,
at the discretion of the speaker/moderator.  Lame humour and irrelevant
asides will be redirected to the bit bucket.
</p><p>Bear in mind that we must vacate the room by 10:00 pm -- but be aware
that many of us adjourn to local ho$pitality e$tabli$hment$ to pursue...
further discussion.  And one of the advantages of a central meeting
place is that the area caters to *all* tastes, age groups, and budgets.
</p><p>Details regarding the specific U of T building and room location,
directions to same, and this month's topic(s) and speaker(s) will be
posted as soon as possible == *very* soon.  Stay tuned!  All the news
will be mirrored on the TLUG website (and right quick - thanks, Don) so
keep an eye on the following link:
