Subject: TLUG Tuesday meeting
From: Drew Sullivan &lt;drew@ss.org&gt;
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1999 01:24:56 -0400
Sender: drew@pentagon.ss.org


TLUG meetings are held at UofT on the second Tuesday of each month at 7:30 pm.

September -&gt; MS2172
October   -&gt; MC254
November  -&gt; MC254
December  -&gt; SF1105 (aka the 'blue room')

MS = Medical Science building,
MC = Mechanical Engineering building (same building we were in during the
summer, but a different room),
SF = Sandford Flemming building.

See http://oracle.osm.utoronto.ca/map/ .


Sept. 14: Jeff Dionne and Michael Durrant from the uClinux project
will be doing a demonstration of their new uCsimm embedded
microcontroller.

University of Toronto (UofT)
Room MS2172
Medical Sciences Building (MS)
1 King's College Circle
19:30-21:30 (7:30pm-9:30pm)

The MedSci building is on the corner of King's College Circle (and it
actually is a circle) and King's College Road (which goes North from
College, first street East of St George). The main entrance is on the
North side of the building. Parking will probably be tough on (and around)
campus, with classes starting an all. I can't remember how draconian the
parking meters are in the area, so if you're going to drive &lt;ech&gt;, keep
'Huron street' in mind.

This month's meeting will be devoted (in part or in whole, however it
goes) to 'Linux on a stick'. We all know Linux is scalable, but an entire
computer the size of a SIMM? Come one, come all.

As always, if you have any questions about Linux, bring them with you. If
you have any question about the meeting itself, ask the list. If you're
too shy to ask 234 subscribers, I offer to (unofficially?) field 'em
(I'd rather take the time to answer questions than have someone miss out).
Just give me time, since I have no mail access at work...
