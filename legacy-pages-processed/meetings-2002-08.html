</dd><dd> Brad Barclay is currently a software developer at large. In his previous incarnation, he was a software developer at the IBM Toronto Lab, writing software for OS/2, Java, Linux, and Unix platforms. Brad has his honours B.Sc. in Computer Science from Brock University in St. Catharines, and has spoke at a variety of users groups and professional developer conferences around the world on a variety of topics. His last major project was the "jSyncManager", a pure-<a href="/web/20081122062744/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Java" title="Java">Java</a> data synchronization solution for Palm-based handheld devices.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Brad is currently a member of the Sony PlayStation2 "cyfc" (Compiled For Your Convenience) development group at <a class="external free" href="/web/20081122062744/http://playstation2-linux.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://playstation2-linux.com">http://playstation2-linux.com</a>, whose goal is to provide a wide variety of precompiled Linux software for the PlayStation2 platform. Brad's contributions to the project include ports of Pine, Pilot, and Pico, and he's currently working on ports of mpg123, FreeCiv, FreeCraft, and Mozilla.

<dl><dt>Description</dt><dd>   Linux is popping up everywhere! Companies and organizations that want to provide a standard OS across device types are putting Linux into everything from wristwatches and PDAs, to mainframe computers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The same phenomenon is occuring in the videogame console industry. Sony's PlayStation 2 development station has always been Linux based, allowing game development companies to develop their wares for the consumer masses.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>More recently, however, Sony has seen fit to release the necessary hardware and software to allow PlayStation 2 owners to run Linux on their own consoles, complete with a suite of PlayStation 2 specific hardware documentation and development tools. The benifits are two-fold: hobbiests get a chance to write software for a hardware platform they wouldn't otherwise have developer access to (using an operating system platform that many developers are already familiar with), and Sony get to build up its cadre of PlayStation 2 developers.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This presentation will introduce the base PlayStation 2 hardware, the new hardware added by the PS2 Linux kit, and will demonstrate a variety of applications that showcase some of the PS2's strengths. It will also include some ideas for future applications using the system.
