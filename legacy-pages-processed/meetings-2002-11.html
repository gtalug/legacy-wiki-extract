</dd><dd> George Belotsky is a highly accomplished expert in software design, with extensive experience as a Chief Scientist, head of an Advanced Software Group, and various senior software architecture roles. Recently back in Toronto after two years in New York City, Mr. Belotsky has been recognized as an individual of extraordinary ability by many leading engineers and scientists.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Prof. Ira Pohl -- author of many books, twice the dean of the Computer Science department at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and fellow of the ACM -- writes about Mr. Belotsky:
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> "He has read several of my texts and eBooks and offered detailed criticisms of my code and explanations, invariably improving both. ... Mr. Belotsky's remarks are of the first rank. For example he was the only reviewer to my knowledge to mention subtle problems to do with object slicing that had escaped other reviewers for over 10 years." 
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Dr. Nenad Kircanski, a world authority in control systems, originator of an entire new field of study in robotics science, and author of software for military flight simulation and nuclear reactor control, writes the following about the work of Mr. Belotsky:
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> "The most important features of his design are reliability, efficiency, and a very high degree of originality. It is also important to mention that Mr. Belotsky has broad knowledge in various fields of human activities and sciences. ... Mr. Belotsky has demonstrated a rarely seen level of ability in software design and development. His systems are unique and constitute many firsts in our industry."

<dl><dt>Description</dt><dd> While Linux has made major gains in areas such as the desktop and embedded systems, it is worthwhile to talk about its original, primary strength as a server system.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Linux -- combined with other Open Source packages -- offers an unprecedented collection of tools for creating high performance servers. This is the first of a two part presentation on such tools. It will be a user-friendly discussion of what is available, without assumption of specialized knowledge on the part of the audience. As always, questions will be welcome.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>After an overview of several popular server packages (such as Zope, Enhydra, JBoss, <a class="external text" href="/web/20081122034619/http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">ACE/TAO</a>), the presentation will focus on the exceptional <a class="external text" href="/web/20081122034619/http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">ACE and TAO libraries</a>. These highly portable Open Source products have been used in avionics, industrial process control, and medical imaging. Boeing currently plans to update the avionics of the F-15 and the F/A-18 aircraft with this software.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Now, you can deploy this Open Source defense grade technology in your own systems. Come learn how to make your server project take off with <a class="external text" href="/web/20081122034619/http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">ACE and TAO</a>!
