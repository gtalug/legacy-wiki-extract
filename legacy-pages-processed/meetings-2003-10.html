</dd><dd> A native of Australia, Robert fell in love with computers early. He was fascinated with networking and multi-user machines in his teen years (the 80s) but it wasn't until he encountered unix (SunOS 4) in 1992 that  he was really happy. By mid 1994 he was running Linux on his home PC and has never looked back. A hobby became a profession as he moved into professional system administration and eventually the security arena. Robert married a Canadian and moved to Toronto in March 2003. He is currently working as a Senior Informtion Security Analyst at the Canadian Depository for Securities in downtown Toronto.

<dl><dd> Robert loves cats, foreign travel, hiking and roller blading. He maintains an active interest in many areas of science and the arts. Robert dislikes dictatorships, drivers who don't pay attention on the road, and pumpkin. He's not sure why he dislikes pumpkin.

<dl><dt>Description</dt><dd> Get more bang for your buck. We'll cover ways to improve system performance and optimise it for your own needs without ever spending a cent on new hardware. This talk discusses software modifications that can be made to kernel parameters, filesystems and the IDE controller so that you get the most out of your existing equipment. Some of the optimisations are generic to all flavours of unix while some are Linux specific (or even specific to particular Linux filesystems). Come and see what your box is really capable of doing.
