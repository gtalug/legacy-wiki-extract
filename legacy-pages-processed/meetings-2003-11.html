<dl><dt>Topic</dt><dd> Six Little Languages (and the problems they solve)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Speaker</dt><dd> <a href="/web/20081012000914/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/David_Tilbrook" title="David Tilbrook">David Tilbrook</a>
</dd><dd> This is Tilbrook's fourth (maybe fifth) TLUG talk, and the first for which he actually had time to prepare and the first specifically prepared for TLUG. Previous presentations were retreads that were sitting in his laptop.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> In fact there was sufficient time to develop a little language to replace PowerPoint.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Over his 42 years experience in computing, starting at UTS in 1961 as a student in the first high school computing course ever mounted (by the late Prof. Tom Hull), David has developed scores of little language processors for a wide range of applications.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> However, those of you who are aware of his work will be relieved that qed will not be discussed -- used naturally, but not discussed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> David is most widely known as the inventor of changing the cursor to show context and the dimming of inactive light buttons.

<dl><dt>Description</dt><dd> The use of little languages, developed to address specific problems can be both profitable (i.e., yields a high R.O.I.) and fun.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> In this presentation we look at the issues involved in the development and use of little languages, some tricks of the trade, and hints of successful strategies through the examination of six little languages developed by the presenter to address problems in the area of Software Configuration and Management.
