</p><p>TLUG meetings are held at the University of Toronto on the second Tuesday of each month at 7:30 pm.
</p><p><b>Date</b>
</p><p>Tuesday December 13, 2005
</p><p><b>Time</b>
</p><p>7:30 pm 
</p><p><b>Topic</b>
</p><p>Open Source Software for Electronic Instrumentation
</p><p><b>Speakers</b>
</p><p>The presenters are Peter Hiscocks and James Gaston, both with Syscomp
Electronic Design Limited. Peter recently retired from a lengthy career
teaching courses in Electrical Engineering at Ryerson University to focus
on the development of low cost, open-source instrumentation for EE
students. James recently completed his MASc in Electrical Engineering at
Ryerson. His thesis project was an autonomous group of mobile robots that
collaborate to climb stairs.
</p><p><b>Description</b>
</p><p>The <a href="/web/20080820080535/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Tcl" title="Tcl">Tcl</a>/Tk language has particular strengths in building virtual
interfaces for electronic equipment. This talk builds on a talk that was
given some years ago to TLUG, outlining the basics of <a href="/web/20080820080535/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Tcl" title="Tcl">Tcl</a>/Tk and showing
its strengths and weaknesses. For example, <a href="/web/20080820080535/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Tcl" title="Tcl">Tcl</a>/Tk has particular strengths
in gluing together other programs or acting as a front end for a legacy
application. It is particularly powerful for rapidly creating a graphical
user interface.
</p><p>In addition to an overview of <a href="/web/20080820080535/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Tcl" title="Tcl">Tcl</a>/Tk, we will demonstrate two electronic
instruments, an oscilloscope and a function generator, that are operated
via USB connections to a <a href="/web/20080820080535/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Tcl" title="Tcl">Tcl</a>/Tk virtual instrument running on a host PC.
USB has a number of attractions but has the potential for being extremely
complex. It is possible to bypass the complexity with a virtual serial
connection, and we'll describe the hardware and software required to do
hassle-free USB.
</p><p>The virtual oscilloscope and virtual function generator applications will
be available as open source.
