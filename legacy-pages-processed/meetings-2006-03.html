</p><p><b>Description</b>
</p><p>What is <a href="/web/20081122061951/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Grep" title="Grep">grep</a>? Why you should care? What 'flavours' of grep are out there? And how to use them?
</p><p>Based on audience interest, I may talk about what regular expressions are, different flavours of regular expression, useability and efficiency considerations, and the expressive power of regular expressions.
