</p><p>Greg Knittl
</p><p><b>Description</b>
</p><p>Part 1 - This talk highlights XSLT 2/XPath 2, but will also touch briefly on Xquery, XForms, SVG and the emerging Compound Document Format.
</p><p>Part 2 - There is a large install base of older but still perfectly good computers that are not Vista capable. Linux could extend the life of these computers.  But installing Linux, especially a dual boot configuration can be challenging.  How to simplify the process to the point where end users can do it themselves, perhaps with guidance?
</p><p>Some of the challenges
- effectively capturing the hardware configuration information required to plan the install
- automatically validating the hardware as much as possible, such as a memory test
- hard drive backup prior to partioning
</p><p>Possible solutions
- custom live CD
- external HDD for backup
</p><p>If we have time for it we will have a 30 Minute brainstorming session on this topic, either in the room or at the GSU over beer.

</p><p>Late evening - After the presentation a large group of Linux fans will move to a nearby pub for further informal socializing.
