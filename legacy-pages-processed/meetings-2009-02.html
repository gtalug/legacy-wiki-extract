</p><p><b>Description</b>
</p><p><a class="external text" href="/web/20100114133707/http://openstreetmap.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap.org</a> creates and provides free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways. 
</p><p>This presentation will introduce you to the breadth and depth of OpenStreetMap and related projects.  You will learn why you should care about maps, how OpenStreetMap is beating every other map, and see some of the amazing things that are being done with OpenStreetMap data and software.  The presentation will bring those with little or no OSM experience up to speed quickly and show how to use OpenStreetMap to make the maps you need.  
</p><p>This topic and presentation is suitable for those with no previous Linux experience as well as the Linux regulars.  You can even bring your non-programming friends and colleagues to this presentation if they have any interest in maps, GPS, neighbourhood advocacy, hiking, cycling, snow sleds or geocaching.
