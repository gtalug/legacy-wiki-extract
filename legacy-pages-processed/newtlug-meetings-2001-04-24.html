<p>The topic originally planned for this month (Backup schemes for Linux) has had to be postponed until next month.  This month we will have:
</p><p>Topic:		Installation, configuration and upgrade of two different Linux distributions: Redhat and Debian
</p><p>Book review:    _RedHat Linux 7 Server_ by Mohammed Kabir.
</p><p>Date:		Tues Apr. 24th.
</p><p>Time:		7-10pm
</p><p>Location:	6th Floor Auditorium Princess Margaret Hospital 610 University Avenue (just south of Queens Park Stn)
</p><p>Directions:	Enter the building from the University Ave entrance (there are two entrances, you want the one that is farther south, you know you have the right one when you see a small Tim Hortons cafe just inside the door).  Proceed toward the back of the building to the atrium area.  You will see two sets of elevators.  One set (glassed into the atrium) only goes to the 5th floor.  The other set can take you to the 6th floor.  When on the 6th floor, proceed around the elevator bays, and the auditorium is clearly marked.
</p><p>Parking:        There is parking behind the PMH on Murray street
</p><p>Topic Outlines:	
</p><p>1)  Redhat installation: <a href="/web/20091012034617/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/James_Harding" title="James Harding">James Harding</a> will demonstrate a Redhat installation highlighting "Linux on the desktop" and show how he configures it for heavy duty office use.
</p><p>2)  Debian installation:  <a href="/web/20091012034617/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Lennart_Sorensen" title="Lennart Sorensen">Lennart Sorensen</a> will show how to install debian, either by network install or from CD. This would include partitioning, package selection tools, configuring key packages, including X, ppp, and maybe sound. If time permits: Lennart will show how to do security upgrades, possibly how to upgrade to a new version, upgrade to a 2.4.x kernel, and reiserfs. Also how to add KDE 2.1 to the system using apt. Debian version will be 2.2r3, which was released about 1 or 2 weeks ago.
</p><p>3)  Book Review: From <a href="/web/20091012034617/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Keith_Mastin" title="Keith Mastin">Keith Mastin</a>: "The book is "RedHat Linux 7 Server" by Mohammed Kabir. I use the book as one of my main resources for setting up my web server. I refer to it especially when accessing the xinetd services, which I found confusing after getting the hang of inetd in RedHat 6.2. Also having a book that was written specifically for servers was a find for me, as I have other books that give simple direction on using Linux on the desktop, but found myself going to Internet resources such as howto's for more in-depth coverage of server configurations. I still go
to the Internet to review those resources, but with the additional information and context that this book provides. I understand that Kabir has written a few books similar to this one, and would highly recommend his books to anyone looking for indepth resource materials based on the quality and coverage of this book."
