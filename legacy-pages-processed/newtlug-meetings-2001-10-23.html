</p><p>1) KDE 2.2.1 desktop by Marcel Gagne. "This is one cool desktop environment. Refined as all get out with plenty of slick enhancements on top of slick enhancements if you've got the horsepower.  That extra pizzazz comes in the form of anti-aliased fonts and icons, multi-print environment support, animated icons 	and cursors, better Konqueror browsing and plug-in     support address completion in Kmail, better organization in the menu system, ridiculously flexible personalization options, and more . . .

</p><p>1.1) I'm sure Marcel's presentation will include other topics from his new book.
</p><p>2) Open discussion and Questions and Answers. There should be time for QnA both re: KDE and general Linux topics or problems.
</p><p>Presenter:	part 1 - Marcel (Free Thinker at Large) Gagne president of Salmar Consulting, Inc. and author of the popular Linux Journal column "Cooking with Linux".  In fact Marcel's articles won the Linux Journal's Readers' Choice Awards for 2001.
</p><p>Marcel is also author of the recently released _Linux System Administration, A User's Guide_ from Addison-Wesley (<a class="internal" href="/web/20081122024818/http://tlug.ss.org/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0201719347">ISBN 0-201-71934-7</a>)  This book is comprehensive yet easy to read, "written for both those who are new to Linux and those who are already proficient".  It "starts with the basics and builds up to more sophisticated material."
