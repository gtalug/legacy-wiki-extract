The NewTLUG meeting will be held in the College Wing Lecture Theatre of the Toronto General Hospital. (just a couple of blocks from the Princess Margret location)
</p><p>Directions:
</p><p>Take the TTC to Queens Park Station and exit at the south-east corner. Head east until you see the large blue sign saying you are at the main entrance of the College Wing. When you enter, proceed to the right doors off the lobby, and go down the stairs one floor.  This is the ground level (all room numbers will have a 'g' in them). Just steps away from the stairs is the Lecture Theatre, and it is labeled so.
</p><p><br/>
Topic:
</p><p>Stephanie will demonstrate website setup and some website development tools including Gimp and Bluefish.  She will include a beginner level discussion/demo of Gimp.
</p><p>Gimp (or *The* Gimp) is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a  freely distributed piece of software suitable for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. No need to pay $500 for a decent photo manipulation tool.

</p><p>Bluefish is a GTK HTML editor for the experienced web designer or programmer. It is not finished yet, but already a very powerful site creating environment. Bluefish has extended support for programming dynamic and interactive websites, there is for example a lot of PHP support. Bluefish is released under the GPL licence.

Note: Steph will be giving a more advanced talk on Gimp at the next TLUG meeting in April.
