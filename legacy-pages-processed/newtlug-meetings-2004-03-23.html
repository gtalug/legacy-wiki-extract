</p><p>Date:		Tues Mar 23rd.
Time:		7-10pm
</p><p>Topic:  	Logic Volume Management and Encrypted File Systems
</p><p>"The Logical Volume Manager, or LVM, is widely used on commercial UNIX systems for online disk storage management. It adds an extra layer between kernel I/O and physical disk devices. In the traditional disk storage schemes, the disk is partitioned into fixed size segments. The LVM
considers all installed disks as pools of data storage.  Each disk is called a Physical Volume (PV) and is part of one pool of data storage
known as a Volume Group (VG). A volume group may consist of multiple physical disks and is represented as one large storage space. The volume group is then divided into partitions called Logical Volumes (LV).  A logical volume acts as one logical disk partition, although it can span
multiple physical disks. Its size can be increased/decreased without any loss of data. A disk may be added to a volume group at any time when there is a need to increase data storage capacity. This provides a great flexibility for changing storage space demands and is useful for combining multiple small capacity disks into one large logical storage space."

<p>Encrypted file systems protect the data on disk media and add strong encryption to programs which don't support them (database, backup image, email, contacts).

He first began to tinker with Linux during his university days, to remotely access various CAD tools residing on Solaris boxes. Being an avid programmer, Pavel finds Linux a perfect platform for work and play, with its wide array of utilities, shells, programming languages, terminals and window managers. Seeking the perfect combination, he has switched flavours several times; from Slackware to Redhat, and finally to Gentoo.
