Topic Details:	As per Emma:
</p><p>"It's a common misconception that newbies don't need to (or aren't qualified to) write documentation; however, newbies are actually BETTER at writing documentation because they take no steps for granted and record every little thing they do--they are also often starting with a system
which is closer to a base install than more advanced users and therefore are able to more accurately capture software dependencies. At The LDP most of the documents we receive are from people who've needed to solve a specific problem that they couldn't solve at first glance. Some of our
documents are newbie level problems, and some are more advanced. 
</p><p>Documentation is also critical in the workplace, or in any situation where there is more than one set of hands on a computer. Maintaining a detailed log of work that's been done on a machine makes it easier to (1) (re)-build a new machine with the same configuration and (2) diagnose
problems including errors in configuration files, software conflicts, and missing modules.
</p><p>Another common misconception is that documentation is too hard to write, takes too much time, or the tools are too difficult to use. As a result
there are holes in knowledge transfer in organizations and important information is lost. The purpose of the presentation is to show how easy it can be to write documentation--including figuring out which tools will help save time."
</p><p>Emma will include:
</p>
<pre>       - doccos: what makes a good technical documentation author, and why you should worship the ground they walk on (ahem)
       - writing a good HOWTO
       - markup languages (specifically DocBook XML 4.x)
       - system configuration for DocBook-&gt;HTML and DocBook-&gt;PDF transformations
       - submitting documents to The Linux Documentation Project
       - other tools your company may want to use for documenting internal processes (specifically Wikis and blogs)
