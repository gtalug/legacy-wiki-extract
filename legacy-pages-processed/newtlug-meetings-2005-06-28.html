<p>As mentioned earlier, our usual meeting room for this month is unavailable, therefore, we will have to cancel this month's NewTLUG meeting. Â :-(
</p><p>We have re-scheduled one of the talks*1 that would have been given this month to Aug 23rd., two month's from now.
</p><p>At this time, we have no other volunteer speakers for the rest of this summer, so please do contact me if you have a talk/demonstration that you would like to present at a future NewTLUG meeting. As noted before, your talk could be the whole meeting, 1/2 of the meeting or a "mini" talk/topic of 10-20 minutes.
</p><p>TIA,
</p><p>Herb Richter...
