               in 1976 and has been working in IT for about 30 years in a
               wide variety of roles including IBM mainframe, legacy

<pre>               Currently he provides network technical support, system
               maintenance, and server builds, to business and advanced
               home users on an independent basis.
</pre>
<pre>               Sometime around 1990 he started into Linux working with
               an Apple Mac running Debian and discovered the

               then he has worked a wide variety hardware,
               distributions, and packages. The main Linux focus now is
               to build, run, and maintain work horse systems on white
               box hardware supporting the back end utility functions
               needed in home and work group environments.
