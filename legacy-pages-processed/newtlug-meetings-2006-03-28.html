</p><p><b>Date:</b>
</p><p>March 28, 2006
</p><p><b>Time:</b>
</p><p>7:00 to 10:00pm
</p><p><b>Presenter:</b>	Geoff Mitchell &lt;geofm@sympatico.ca&gt;
		Geoff having spent years in the Windows world has recently
		switched to Linux and will share his experience searching
		for a comfortable <a href="/web/20081007022341/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Linux_distributions" title="Linux distributions">Linux distribution</a> and demonstrate some
		of the features that he found important.
</p><p>Topic 1:	<a class="external text" href="/web/20081007022341/http://pclinuxos.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://pclinuxos.com">PCLinuxOS</a> as well as <a class="external text" href="/web/20081007022341/http://mepis.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://mepis.org">Simply MEPIS</a> are      considered to be two
		of the easiest Linux distributions to install and use by
		former Windows-only now new Linux users.
		Both require little or no command line configuration -
		just "point and click" a few timesÂ :-)
</p><p>		Geoff says of <a class="external text" href="/web/20081007022341/http://pclinuxos.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://pclinuxos.com">PCLinuxOS</a>:
		"It is the most complete "off the [installation] mark"
		distribution that I have ever installed. It takes a
		minimum of setup -- the installation is really quite
		automated. In that sense the installation is pretty
		straightforward, even easier than Windows. After
		installation it's ready to use."
</p><p>Topic 2:	- lots of time for Q&amp;A
		- more planning and discussion re our meeting next month
		to be held at Linux World. - discussion as to the content
		tone and message we would like to present at this very
		public forum.
