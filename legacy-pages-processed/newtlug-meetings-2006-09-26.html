</p><p>Topic:		As a result of last month's meeting, it has been
		suggested that we include into each NewTLUG meeting, a
		couple of short regular topics or features.  Four have
		been suggested with one or two to be chosen each month:
</p><p>	1)	"Command Line 101"  ...a look at and discussion of useful
		or essential command line commands such as grep, cpio,
		rsync, ssh, scp, sftp, dd, ps, kill, cron, find ...
</p><p>	2)	"Under the Hood"  ...a look at other essentials such as
		GUIs, communications, file systems, administration tools.
</p><p>	3)	"LPI Quiz"  ...a few questions from a typical LPI exam for
		audience members to answer.
</p><p>	4)	"Stump the Chump"  ...questions from the floor to a guest
		or designated question-answerer (?)
</p><p><br/>
Presenter(s):	a panel of various GTA long time Linux users (and anyone
		who wants to join inÂ ;)
