</p><p>The tentative topic for this month is:
"shell expansion"  ie:
</p>
<ul><li> wildcards etc,
</li><li> what to do when they fail (xargs, find...|, perl's readdir etc)
</li><li> scope of expansion (ie what gets passed to the command - esp. if the expansion does not match any entries in the working dir)
</li></ul>
<p>also practical limits to directory sizes
