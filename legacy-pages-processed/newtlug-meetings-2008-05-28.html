</p><p>2) Ken Brown ripping CDs / DVDs under Linux. Ken Brown notes:
</p><p>"I am planning to show how to use Konqueror to rip and encode CD's in one step.  Konqueror can encode Ogg, Mp3, Wav, and Flac all in one pass.
</p><p>The other piece of software I will talk about is cdparanoia.  It has an excellent error correcting function. I will bring a badly scratched disc and have it play perfectly.
</p><p>For people using Gnome-based distro's, like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc,  I will mention Grip, and Lame."
