<p>Here are the details for the next TPM meeting.
</p>
<pre>   Date:   Thursday 28 July 2005
</pre>
<pre>   Time:   6:45pm (talk starts)
</pre>
<pre>   Where:  2 Bloor Street West (NW corner of Yonge/Bloor, skyscraper
           with the CIBC logo on top), room / floor to be announced
</pre>
<pre>   Who:    Simon Ditner
</pre>
<pre>   What:   *&amp;#!perl - Using Perl with <a href="/web/20081006072507/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Asterisk" title="Asterisk">Asterisk</a>
</pre>
<pre>           Asterisk is a relatively new open source PBX/IVR/VoIP
           platform running on Linux and commodity hardware, promising
           to have a large impact on the telecom world by providing a
           cheap alternative to proprietary solutions.
           One of it's many strengths is that it allows you to directly
           interact with the call logic (dialplans) and the media
           channels using the AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface). This
           talk will briefly cover Asterisk dialplans and media
           channels, then explore building some simple scripts using
           the Asterisk::AGI perl module and the different ways Perl
           can be invoked from Asterisk.
</pre>
<p><br/>
Note:
</p>
<pre>           The elevators in the building are "locked down" after 5:30pm
           to people without building access cards.  Leading up to
           6:45pm someone will come down to the main floor lobby every
           few minutes to ferry people upstairs.  After that, you can
           reach the access-card-carrying access guy via a cell phone
           number that we'll leave with security in the front lobby.
           The room and floor numbers will be left with security too.
