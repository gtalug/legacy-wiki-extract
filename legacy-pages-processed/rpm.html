<p>The Red Hat Package Management tool was actually created by Caldera (back before they were involved with SCO) to manage installation of software packages.
</p><p>It assists in both building and installing software packages, with an awareness of dependencies (e.g. - KSpread, the KDE spreadsheet, depends on having various KDE and Qt libraries, and so will require that, to install kspread, the other required system components be installed as well).  
</p><p>It supports the notion of versioning, so that your system can be aware of what components must be upgraded together.  
</p><p>It also supports doing relatively orderly deinstallation of software; you can ask to remove a package, and this will be done, if that doesn't break something else by removing some dependency that was required to remain.
