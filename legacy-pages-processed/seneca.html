Improving non-root Opie

1) Fix opie-login
   Currently, without manual intervention, opie-login can only successfully
login root.  If the owner of /tmp/qtembedded-0/ and its contents are changed to
the desired user after opie-login loads up, but before logging in as that user,
the login acts as expected.  The owner of /tmp/qtembedded-0/ and its contents
needs to be set back to root at some point during the logout, prior to
opie-login attempting to display anything, or opie-login will die.

2) System configuration
   Some of Opie's applications, primarily those located in the "Settings" tab,
need to be root for their changes to be written and take effect.  A small,
non-graphical, suid application that allows users to alter specified files can
be written and called as needed by libqpe's Config class and directly.

3) Fix starting applications as non-root without opie-login
   Most applications die with an error creating a semaphore if started as
non-root from the console.  This used not to happen.  The applications do,
however, start when run with strace or after another Opie application has
successfully been run by that user.
