<p>Robert Brockway has stated that he should be the only person to add talks, but what of the early talks that I've dug up information about?  Does he really want the task of adding in those early meetings?  I don't see much room for conflict if I deal with digging up and posting the past meetings, and he does current and future. --<a href="/web/20061013110238/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 06:40, 10 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>Robert should be the one to have final say on a talk, but the talk author should be allowed to add his own information if he so desires.
</p><p>As for back filling, be my guest.

</p><p>I agree with Drew.  For planning future talks, let Robert add the entries if that's what he'd like.  For historical stuff.. we'll love you for adding the old meetings.  I also see no problem whatsoever in being revisionist and adding additional notes, comments or reformatting/linking stuff.  Every drop of effort is a permanent gain. -- <a href="/web/20061013110238/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20061013110238/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 16:39, 10 May 2005 (EDT)
