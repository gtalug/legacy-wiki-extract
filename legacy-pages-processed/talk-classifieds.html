</p><p>Amazon.com, headquartered in beautiful Seattle, is looking for exceptional software engineers to join its growing technology organization. Our engineering team works on tough technical problems that engage and stretch their brains.

You’ll work with smart, experienced teammates on a small cross-functional team. You’ll join a scientific culture focused on achieving aggressive goals. And, you’ll work on creating a world-class customer experience for the millions of people who use Amazon.com.
</p><p>The Digital Media Technology group is growing team of software innovators that serves as a digital media incubation lab for Amazon.com. We are seeking software developers to help drive and define Amazon’s growth in new digital businesses across books, magazines, music, video and other categories.
</p><p>We build unique and exciting digital experiences that delight our customers. Sometimes we create something amazingly useful, such as Search Inside the Book™, which helps millions of customers decide whether they want to purchase a specific book. Other times we develop customer experiences that are just plain fun. The common elements of our work include an eclectic set of rich media and taking what’s possible with digital media to the next level. 
</p><p>Of course we think our work is pretty cool, but don’t take our word for it.

And don’t worry – there’s still plenty of inventing left to do. If the work you’re currently doing doesn’t put you on the digital forefront or isn’t being appreciated by at least 42 million people every day, consider joining our team. 
</p><p>Successful candidates for this position will have a strong background in Algorithms, Data Structures, Distributed Systems, Java, and C++. Experience working with web applications is a plus. Equally important are your ability to multi-task, quickly adapt to new development environments, learn new systems, create reliable/maintainable code, and find creative and scalable solutions to difficult problems. The ability to communicate clearly and concisely (both written and orally) is a key competency as is being a self-starter.
