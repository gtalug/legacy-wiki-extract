<p>If we end up with a lot of different kinds of people / contacts / companies, then this could be rebuilt as a slick little comparison table.  See <a class="extiw" href="/web/20090417175156/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software" title="Wikipedia:Comparison of wiki software">Wikipedia:Comparison of wiki software</a> for an idea of how tabling could look. -- <a href="/web/20090417175156/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090417175156/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>
</p><p>Some ideas for the kinds of things which ought to be stated:
</p>
<ul><li> What services are provided?
</li><li> What is the target customer?
</li><li> What are your hours of operation?
</li><li> How immediate can service be obtained?
</li><li> What kind of long-term solutions exist?
</li><li> Are there service plans?
</li></ul>
<p>I'm also guessing that this topic should be expanded to not just cover consultants, but also various services too! -- <a href="/web/20090417175156/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090417175156/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>
</p><p>I forsee a budding issue with the interest to add other corporate solutions.  For one, we don't want to hedge out our little guys, and yet we do want to have a listing.  Some sort of referral system should also be set up somehow.  Testimonials would work.  Well, I'll just start throwing things in, and things will fall where they may.  Later we should discuss this once it becomes a noticible issue. -- -- <a href="/web/20090417175156/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090417175156/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 23:22, 17 Jun 2005 (EDT)
