<p>How should this concept be presented?
</p>
<ul><li> Should it be broken up into two pages -- one for TLUG-specific (i.e. "official TLUG events") and one with events which TLUG members regularly attend?  It's really cool to list non-TLUG stuff, and I like seeing a "greater community".
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It could be broken up into a "calender" concept.. a really slick table could present which things happened on which days.  Clicking on a day would hop down to a larger event description.
</li></ul>
<p>Ideas are welcome.  Also, anyone is welcome to, as they say, "be bold" (edit freely).
