<ul><li> Just a quick note: I've just discovered that the <a class="external text" href="/web/20060602095605/http://linux.senecac.on.ca/" rel="nofollow" title="http://linux.senecac.on.ca">Seneca Linux Club</a> is holding an installfest at Seneca@York on the same day as ours.  I don't think it'll cause many problems for our installfest since it looks like theirs is only for students/staff of the college. --<a href="/web/20060602095605/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 20:22, 15 May 2005 (EDT)
