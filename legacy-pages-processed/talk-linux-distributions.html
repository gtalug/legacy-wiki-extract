<p>IDon'tKnowAboutYou, but I hate camelcase.  This page needs to be renamed.. but to what?  It seems to be all about release announcements.  Should we have a general "distributions" topic? -- <a href="/web/20080820080150/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20080820080150/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>
</p><p>I would put forward that this topic should have a good introduction to it.  This can't be yet another linux distribution page.. there are a billion of them out there.  How should the "personalness" of the topic be conveyed? -- <a href="/web/20080820080150/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20080820080150/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>
</p><p>Agreed.  What about a review of on-going advantages and disadvantages of various distros that GTALUG members have familiarity with?  i.e. Fedora Core, Novell SUSE Linux, Gentoo, Knoppix etc. etc.
</p><p>For my part, having installed/used about ten of them, there are pros and cons to each.  Maybe the bigger question should be:  what distro has what advantage for what type of user? Obviously, database and web backends will have very different needs from, say a desktop business user. -- <a href="/web/20080820080150/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:XB-70" title="User:XB-70">XB-70</a>
