<p>I believe this page should be broken down into:
</p>
<ul><li> A brief introduction to this "Linux" thing, with links to fairly official descriptions and resources.
</li><li> A user-contributed link area.  I think maybe I should do a bit of a writeup to express that anyone can edit it to add new items, or remove dead items or whatever.
<ul><li> Basically, the linking concept is something that anyone can choose to be selfish about.. dump your own personal links and manage them here.. then everyone benefits, and when someone else does the same, you benefit.  =)
</li><li> Ideas for sectioning will be welcome.. I think that structure is very important for a fairly free-for-all link dump.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
