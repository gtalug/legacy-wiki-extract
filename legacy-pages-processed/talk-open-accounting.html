<p>Open accounting has been a concept I've been kicking around for some time.  I feel that it ought to be standardized at the government level.  After all, I'm not particularly happy about my tax dollars being quietly shuffled around without my knowledge or approval.  Well, at any rate.. I suppose a user group accounting project would be as good a start as any. -- <a href="/web/20090228162122/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090228162122/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 18:20, 15 May 2005 (EDT)

<ul><li> After discussion with Herb from <a href="/web/20090228162122/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/NewTLUG" title="NewTLUG">NewTLUG</a>, it appears to me that accounting on this kind of medium would be far too open and untrusted.  An accounting program that did the math behind the scenes and generated a web page would be better received.  Organization and discussion would still work well on a wiki though. -- <a href="/web/20090228162122/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090228162122/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 11:29, 25 May 2005 (EDT)
