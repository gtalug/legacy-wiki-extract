<p>I have just purchased a HP Pavilion a1250n computer with a sata hard drive.
</p><p>I have been using Linux full time since 1997, and I am not considered a newbie by any means.
</p><p>However, I have come across a problem that for the first time I can not seem to resolve.
</p><p>Linux does not seem to recognize the sata hard drive that is in this HP Pavilion. It hangs just after the following boot sequence,
</p><p>Lading sata_sil
Ata1: SATA max udma/100 cmd OxF880E080 ct1 OxF88oeo8a bmdma oxF880E000 irq 11
Ata2: SATA max udma/100 cmd )xF880Eoco ct1 OxF88oEoca bmda OxF880E008 irq 11
Input: 1mEX ps/2 Logitecch explorer mouse on isa0060/serial01
Ata1: Dev o ata, max udma/100 488397168 sectors: lba48
</p><p>At this point it will not load the hard drive controller. I have tried using other sata drivers but none will work.
</p><p>However, I can boot linux in safe mode.
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated since HP canâ€™t help me. I want my Linux back.
</p><p>Regards
