<ul><li>dude, you excluded it from being cached!  D'oh! Â ;(
</li><li>had to setup a basic robots file on the new box to stop msnbot from killing our bbs statistics.  On the old server I was letting google and googlebot handle all of my search needs so there might be some things out there.  Unfortunately, the stuff that I'd like to find wasn't really material that google would likely cache.  (tarballs, rpms, perl scripts, etc)

<p>Most fortunately - the wiki appears to be far better suited on the collaboration front and as such has saved me tonnes of work.  =) -- <a href="/web/20090109062502/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Dl33t" title="User:Dl33t">User:Dl33t</a>
</p><p>True, that.  The wiki emphasises 'interest'.  When three people are interested in a topic, it blossoms.  When less people are interested, it'll stagnate.. when more are interested, it gets wierd.  =)  -- <a href="/web/20090109062502/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090109062502/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>

<ul><li> Your use of namespaces, while fine, can be done as Namespace:Title.. MediaWiki can have namespaces added so that those different spaces can be acted upon a bit differently.  Personally I think it's a bit of a waste.
</li><li> - I can't figure out how to get sub-pages to properly work in a regular topic.  If you go to a name page (try <a href="/web/20090109062502/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">User:Sy</a>) and make a link like [[/link]] then that page will leave a breadcrumb back to the name page.  However this functionality doesn't exist elsewhere.. I don't get it.  =/
</li><li> - So that /link concept would be *perfect* instead of namespaces, at least for doing basic organization.. uh.. I don't know why I'm writing this.  Oh yeah.. one day I might swoop by and move pages around to satisfy some sort of organization, but right now it doesn't matter.. so your naming convention is just fine.  =) -- <a href="/web/20090109062502/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20090109062502/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>
