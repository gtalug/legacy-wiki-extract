<p><a href="/web/20080704190006/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Cbbrowne" title="User:Cbbrowne">cbbrowne</a>  At the 2006-01-22 board meeting, we discussed the notion of setting up a central "Resources" page whose URL we would put onto business cards for distribution at the <a href="/web/20080704190006/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/IT360" title="IT360">IT360</a> conference.
</p><p>The notion was that we should pick some set of topics that are likely to be of some general interest that we have some local expertise on.  For each topic, we should have pointers both to traditional "global" resources (e.g. - to <a class="external free" href="/web/20080704190006/http://samba.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://samba.org/">http://samba.org/</a>, for SAMBA) as well as to local resources that might be able to render local assistance.  Here are a set of things we noticed there seemed to be local expertise on...
</p><p>Each should have its own Wiki page consisting of pointers to global resources (HOWTOs and such) as well as to any local support sources and pointers to any local talks that have taken place.
