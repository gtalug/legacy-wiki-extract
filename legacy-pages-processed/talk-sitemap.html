<p>I think it is bad to have this page locked if it is supposed to be one of the main sources of navigation for the site.  User's can't update it when new major sections are added, for example, under Community Portal or such.  -- <a href="/web/20081005152721/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Leah" title="User:Leah">Leah</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081005152721/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Leah" title="User talk:Leah">(talk)</a></sup>
</p><p>I totally agree with you.  I've already unlocked the main page.  Now I'll unlock sitemap as well.  My original concern was with graffiti and such.. but we've got enough trusted user activity to clean up any problems.  Drop a note on my talk page for any other pages which should be unlocked.  -- <a href="/web/20081005152721/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081005152721/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 18:26, 3 May 2005 (EDT)
