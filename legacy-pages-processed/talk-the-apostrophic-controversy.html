<p>Simply put, I don't believe that "The Apostrophic Controversy" belongs on this page.  I fail to see the relevance it has to GTALUG's history.  The U in GTALUG is officially spelled "Users", hence there is no controversy.  My opinion on it is that it should be on its own page, either as <a class="new" href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/index.php?title=User:Lpetrazickis&amp;action=edit" title="User:Lpetrazickis">Lpetrazickis's</a> userpage or linked to by it, as I can't think of a location where it would otherwise properly belong at this point in time.  If there were a random-LUG-related-info category, as a page, "The Apostrophic Controversy" would fit.  --<a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 22:08, 12 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>It's a pretty big section which deserves its own topic, so as to clean up this page.  In fact, various other sections here would end up in their own pages if they got big enough.. as that's the nature of the wiki.  I've opened a new sub-topic:  <a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/About" title="About">About</a> &gt; <a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Random" title="Random">Random</a> &gt; <a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/The_apostrophic_controversy" title="The apostrophic controversy">The apostrophic controversy</a> which would hold interesting tidbits like this.  <b>However</b> if this is something which has historical significance -- i.e. the debate itself was a milestone in the history of the group -- then it should of course be linked to in this page. As I wasn't there, I won't make that call. -- <a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 23:16, 12 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>Off hand, I can't think of a single debate about the U being singular/plural/possesive/non-possesive in all the years that I've trawled through. --<a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 23:47, 12 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>That's good enough for me.  Unless other users, including <a class="new" href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/index.php?title=User:Lpetrazickis&amp;action=edit" title="User:Lpetrazickis">Lpetrazickis</a>, drop in to form a stronger general opinion, the content-move should be fine.  I'm moving this conversation to its talk page, and also adding the question: If Seneca doesn't remember such a controversy, and if others don't verify it.. did it exist?  Can we get a mailing list archive on this topic? -- <a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 07:16, 13 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>The only mentions of apostraphes that I came across in a quick dredging through the archives is in a posting about <a class="external text" href="/web/20061013111142/http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.tolug/7929" rel="nofollow" title="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.tolug/7929">Open Office and PDFs</a> and <a class="external text" href="/web/20061013111142/http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:http%3A%2F%2Fdissemble.net%2Ftlug-archive%2F02-04%2F23706.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:http://dissemble.net/tlug-archive/02-04/23706.html">"strange characters"</a>.  And I didn't notice anything about plurality/singularity.  It seems like the past TLUGers were more concerned with designing a logo than with how to expand the U. --<a href="/web/20061013111142/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 10:33, 13 May 2005 (EDT)
