</p><p>Let's make this pretty!
</p><p>It's not too hard to design a decent template.. we could do some nice tabling, headers.. colour.. stuff like that.
</p><p>Is it important that email vs this be easy to copy back and forth?  I argue no.. we should make this template nice and shiny (and still accessible with lynx) and worry about email separately.
</p><p>Technically the rendered page could be cut-and-pasted into a text email.. and still look good.. couldn't it?
