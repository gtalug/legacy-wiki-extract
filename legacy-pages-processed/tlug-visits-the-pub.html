Dear Friends,

[Please excuse the short notice. I only found about Jon's visit yesterday.]

Jon "maddog" Hall makes cameo appearance in Toronto

I am pleased to announce that Jon "maddog" Hall, Senior Technology
Leader at Digital Equipment Corporation and well known Linux
celebrity, will be meeting our group in an informal setting at The Bishop 
and the Belcher pub on Wednesday, July 16, 1997 starting at 7:30 pm.

Jon is executive president of Linux International and a regular contributor
to the Linux Journal, the Linux movement's flagship publication.

This chance to meet a Linux celebrity and share ideas is not to be missed,
and I cordially invite everyone to come out and take advantage of this
fabulous opportunity.

A brief biography of Mr Hall follows:  

Jon Hall has been in the computer industry for over a quarter century, 
17 years of that with UNIX. He has been a software engineer, systems
administrator, product manager, marketing manager and professional educator.
Currently working for Digital Equipment Corporation in the Digital UNIX
Marketing group, he previously worked for Bell Laboratories. Before that he
was Department Head of Computer Science at Hartford State Technical College,
where his students lovingly (he hopes) gave him the nickname maddog. maddog
(as he prefers to be called) has an MS inComputer Science from RPI (1977)
and a BS in Commerce and Engineering from Drexel University(1973).

The Bishop and the Belcher pub is located on Queen Street West, near
Spadina Avenue, in downtown Toronto. It is easily accessible by the subway,
(take the Spadina line south and get off at Osgoode). For a map of
the Toronto subway system, please refer to the webpage located at:

        Cheers,

              Laszlo Herczeg
