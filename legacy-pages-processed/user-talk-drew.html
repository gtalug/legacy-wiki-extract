<p>Btw, regarding <a href="/web/20081006072839/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Meetings" title="Meetings">meetings</a>, they don't need to be put into a category because I use "breadcrumb navigation" (the links at the top all lead back to meetings). -- <a href="/web/20081006072839/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081006072839/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>
