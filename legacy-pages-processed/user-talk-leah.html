<p>Hi -- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Leah" title="User:Leah">Leah</a> / <sup><strong>(talk)</strong></sup>
</p><p>I've unlocked <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Sitemap" title="Sitemap">Sitemap</a> for you.  Strangely enough I unlocked the main page just minutes before reading your comment on <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Talk:Sitemap" title="Talk:Sitemap">Talk:Sitemap</a>.  =)
</p><p>- Also, you can sign with ~~~ or ~~~~(timestamp), and you can edit your preferences to change your signature.  The template is an interesting idea though, because it lets you change your signature later. -- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>

Thanks for unlocking <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Sitemap" title="Sitemap">Sitemap</a>.  Is this the correct way to respond (somewhat unfamiliar with talk stuff so far).
</p><p>Well, there's no such thing as correct.  Me, I like to drag the conversation back to the person's talk page so they're notified and the conversation is immediately handy.  A lot of people only continue a discussion on the article's talk page, but sometimes discussion falls by the wayside.  Some people just continue the conversation where it is and may notify the person on their talk page if it's important. -- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 18:50, 3 May 2005 (EDT)

<p>I changed a lot of the sitemap to pull templates recently, let me know if you hate the idea, but we were getting inconsistancy in the menus on varios subpages and it was driving me nuts that I had to add the <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Installfests" title="Installfests">Installfests</a> link in three places.  Also notes on what I did with regards to the logo are at <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Local_Wiki_Installation_Notes" title="Local Wiki Installation Notes">Local_Wiki_Installation_Notes</a>-- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Leah" title="User:Leah">Leah</a> / <sup><strong>(talk)</strong></sup>
</p><p>The templates need a bit of whitespace.. text seems to jam up on the left side.  That aside, things look great.  I'll have a walk through the wiki and doublecheck the linking and subpages, but it's actually fairly maintainable from my perspective.. although I'm a bit wierd.  The logo is captivating.. I love it.  Btw, grats on making admin.. you look like you're having a blast! =) -- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 23:19, 7 May 2005 (EDT)

<p>I'm noticing some of your preferences.  I have no problem per se. with any of it.
</p>
<ul><li> Headers -- I rather prefer having more whitespace between the horizontal rules and such because I find it to be more readable.  I take it that you want to make the header smaller to give more room for content?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Templating -- Templating is an interesting solution to the problem of adding new entries into the various sections.  It'll definitely have to be tidied up here and there just for presentation, but I think it'll do well.  Nice work.
</li></ul>

<p>&gt; Headers -- I rather prefer having more whitespace between the horizontal rules and such because I find it to be more readable. I take it that you want to make the header smaller to give more room for content?
</p><p>The problem is that if we have people with lower resolutions, even 1024x768 the actual useful content of the page ends up being somewhere where they can't see it (bottom of page)f.  It's not a problem for higher resolutions, but it is fairly ugly to see nothing but page garbage at the top of the page.  Maybe we should ask people what they prefer?  
</p><p>Another possibility would be to put things like the navigational links at the bottom of each page, but I find that kind of annoying too as then you've got to scroll down to see them. -- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Leah" title="User:Leah">Leah</a> / <sup><strong>(talk)</strong></sup>
</p><p>Hmm.. I like the headers staying as headers.. I find it much easier to navigate through things without scrolling down.  I don't mind the way things are, and if lower resolution users have a concern then that's good enough for me to remove whitespaces.  Yes, perhaps we should ask around to see if there really is a concern, but to be honest it feels a bit more ethical to just consider them without making it a big deal.  Actually, the one thing I'd like to see is the ability to turn the sidebar off with the default skin.. I hate wasting that space.  -- <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>

<p>1.5 is out, and one feature is that a <a href="/web/20081006073342/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Monobook.css" title="MediaWiki:Monobook.css">MediaWiki:Monobook.css</a> allows for some rather nice customizations.  Maybe it would be useful here?
