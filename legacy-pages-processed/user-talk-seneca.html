<p>Hey Seneca.. I understand you've been collecting usergroup presentations.  Is there an official home for them? -- <a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 22:37, 30 Apr 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>None that I know of at this point, and the collection is still very small in number.  --<a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 13:04, 1 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>Ok then.. if I may, I'm interested in hosting them here, and putting some effort in asking around to get more.  Alongside proper meeting minutes, presentations would be nice to have imo. -- <a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> 18:13, 3 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>Be prepared for the presentation info to take some space; the largest size mentioned so far for a set of slides is 15MB (although that particular link 404s). I'm also going to create a 'GTALUG Archeology' page with my current info-digging status on it, linked from my page. --<a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 09:19, 9 May 2005 (EDT)
</p><p>Good stuff.  I think that these presentations will be more than just a mere curiosity.  A growing database of such presentation is a sort of "proof of activity" in a sense.. aside from having legitimate value.  One thing which should be discussed is the notion of licenses on those presentations.  For each one, someone has spent some time on it.. also, some of them may not have freely redistributable pictures or such.. so it might not be as easy as putting them online.  Well, it's not a big deal right now, but it's something to think about soonish. -- <a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup>

<hr/>
<p>Your recent "meeting header template" modifications to the existing meetings have resulted in every existing meeting having an unfilled copy of the meeting template above the actual meeting info. --<a href="/web/20081007211239/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Seneca" title="User:Seneca">Seneca</a> 10:53, 11 May 2005 (EDT)
