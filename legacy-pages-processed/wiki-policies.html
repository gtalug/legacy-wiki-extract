<pre>Policies for this wiki.

<p><br/>
Right now these are just general guidelines so I don't have to feel guilty about doing the right thing.  Feel free to discuss things on this page's talk page, and we'll hammer out a document that everyone will be happy with. -- <a href="/web/20081011174413/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User:Sy" title="User:Sy">Sy</a> / <sup><a href="/web/20081011174413/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/User_talk:Sy" title="User talk:Sy">(talk)</a></sup> (<a href="/web/20081011174413/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Wiki_maintainer" title="Wiki maintainer">Wiki maintainer</a>)

<dl><dt> A person's name page is their own  </dt><dd> Within reason, a person can do whatever they'd like with their own talk page, and it should be left reasonably alone by other users.  A user can make sub-pages (make links like [[/link]]) in their talk page for organization of their notes.  Hard drive space isn't much of a concern for simple pages, but pages which draw special attention (i.e. bandwidth) should probably find a home on a personal box.

<dl><dt> Locking       </dt><dd> Critical components will be locked from editing.  This includes official policies, major templates and the like.  See <a href="/web/20081011174413/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Special:Log/protect" title="Special:Log/protect">Special:Log/protect</a>.  <a href="/web/20081011174413/http://tlug.ss.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Do" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Do">~Do</a>:  <small>Is there a list of protected pages?</small>
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p>
<dl><dt> Trolling       </dt><dd> Constructive criticism is welcome.  Use the article's talk page.  Stomping around in an article to change it too radically is not a good idea and is probably begging for a reversion.  Argue on a discussion page until a fair decision is made.
</dd></dl>
<p><br/>
</p>
<dl><dt> Graffiti      </dt><dd> Graffiti will not be tolerated, and banning will be for continually longer terms.  Particularly naughty IPs will be banned from visiting *.ss.org
