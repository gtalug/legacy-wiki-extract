<p><b>Why OANDA?</b>
</p><p>OANDA is a unique company.  It's not a Web upstart or a bank.  It’s a technology company that innovates both in computer engineering and financial modeling for the Foreign Currency Exchange Trade market.  OANDA has experienced continued growth since its founding in 1996, and opportunities for employees remain unprecedented as the company creates new products that redefine the forex market.  With a daily capitalization of $3 trillion, the forex market dwarfs both the US bond and equity markets.<br /><br /> 
</p><p>What's at the root of OANDA's success?  The Employees.  As an employee you will constantly develop innovative technology in an almost lab-like environment.  You will develop and challenge your skills every day.  You will have the ability to be self-directed in your work within a collaborative team structure.  You’ll enjoy the immediacy of a small company, but use the most advanced tools/technologies that a large firm can offer.  And to maintain that community feel at OANDA we offer flexibility &amp; sociability with things like catered lunches, on-site massage therapists, Friday @ 4 gatherings and more.
