</p><p>Did you know that Amazon.com has hundreds of software engineers working on some of the most interesting technical challenges on the planet?
</p><p>Amazon.com, headquartered in beautiful Seattle, is looking for exceptional software engineers to join its growing technology organization. Our engineering team works on tough technical problems that engage and stretch their brains. As an engineer here, you might build cutting edge product recommendation algorithms, scale and optimize our world class supply chain systems, or architect and build an end-to-end e-commerce platform that companies like Target use to run their online business. You’ll work with smart, experienced teammates on a small cross-functional team. You’ll join a scientific culture focused on achieving aggressive goals. And, you’ll work on creating a world-class customer experience for the millions of people who use Amazon.com.
</p><p>The Digital Media Technology group is growing team of software innovators that serves as a digital media incubation lab for Amazon.com. We are seeking software developers to help drive and define Amazon’s growth in new digital businesses across books, magazines, music, video and other categories.

And don’t worry – there’s still plenty of inventing left to do. If the work you’re currently doing doesn’t put you on the digital forefront or isn’t being appreciated by at least 42 million people every day, consider joining our team. 
</p><p>Successful candidates for this position will have a strong background in Algorithms, Data Structures, Distributed Systems, Java, and C++. Experience working with web applications is a plus. Equally important are your ability to multi-task, quickly adapt to new development environments, learn new systems, create reliable/maintainable code, and find creative and scalable solutions to difficult problems. The ability to communicate clearly and concisely (both written and orally) is a key competency as is being a self-starter.
